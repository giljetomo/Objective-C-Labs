# Threelow Game

The game we're going to make is called 'Threelow'. It's similar to Yahtzee, but
with much simpler scoring. To play, a player rolls five dice. The goal is to get
the lowest score possible. Each roll they must choose to hold at least one of
the dice, but they can choose to hold as many as five dice. If they have
un-held dice, they re-roll until all five dice are held.
Threes are worth 0 points (hence the name of the game), every other roll is
worth its face value. Whoever has the lowest score after everyone has had a
complete turn wins the game
