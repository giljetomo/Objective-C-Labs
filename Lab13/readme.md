# Pig Latin

Pig Latin is a language game that is used by children and a few strange adults to speak in code. Here's how it works: take any word in the English language and move the first consonant (or group of consonants) if there are to the end of the word, then add and an ‘ay' to the end. So if we took ‘Kale Chips' it would become ‘Alekay Ipschay'.
